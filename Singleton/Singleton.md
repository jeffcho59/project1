Singleton Pattern

A Singleton Pattern is a creational pattern. It restricts the instantiation of a 
class to a single object. It is used with a class and creates a new instance of 
the class if it already doesn't exist. If it does exist, it just refers to it. 
Singletons serve as a shared resource namespace which isolate implementation code 
form the global namespace to provide a single point of access for functions.
