What is a Design Pattern?


A design pattern is a template to solve the problems that we have (Javascript). 
They're reusable software solutions that are used for common problems that programmers 
experience when writing code.


Since design patterns are solutions that are often used for common problems, many programmers 
are familiar with design patterns. The sooner you learn and are familiar with design patterns, 
the sooner you will learn the vocabulary for developers to communicate easier and faster.

Design patterns prevent minor issues that can cause major problems in the application development 
process. They also provide generalized solutions which are documented in a fashion that doesn't 
require them to be tired to a specific problem. It can also decrease the file size footprint code 
by avoiding repetition.
