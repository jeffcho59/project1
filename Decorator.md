Decorator Pattern

A Decorator Pattern is a structural pattern that aims to promote code 
re-use. They're used to modify existing systems where we want to add 
more features to objects without needing to modify the object itself 
and its code heavily. With a decorator, we work with a single base 
object and little by little, we add decorator objects which provide 
additional capabilities. Developers might use decorators because they 
might have a large number of distinct objects in their application.
