Factory Pattern


The Factory Pattern is a creational pattern that's related to the idea of 
creating objects. Instead of requiring a constructor, a Factory can make 
an interface for creating objects. After, we can specify the type of factory 
object we want created. We tell the Factory what type of object we want and it 
instantiates it for us to use. This is useful if the object creation process is complex.
