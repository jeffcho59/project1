Observer Pattern

The observer pattern is a behavioral pattern where an object maintains 
a list of objects depending on observers. It automatically notifies the 
observers of any changes to state. When it needs to be notified, it 
broadcasts a notification to the observers. When we don't want an observer 
to be notified anymore, we simply take it off the list.
